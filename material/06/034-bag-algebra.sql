-- Playground: SQL's bag algebra does respect row multiplicities

INSERT INTO bag2(row) VALUES
  ('A'), ('B'), ('B'), ('D');

FROM bag2;

-- bag union
FROM bag1 UNION ALL FROM bag2;
FROM bag1 UNION     FROM bag2;      -- discard duplicates

-- Simulate UNION using UNION ALL/DISTINCT:
SELECT DISTINCT row
FROM   (FROM bag1 UNION ALL FROM bag2);



-- bag intersection
FROM bag1 INTERSECT ALL FROM bag2;
FROM bag1 INTERSECT     FROM bag2;  -- discard duplicates

-- Simulate INTERSECT using INTERSECT ALL/DISTINCT:
SELECT DISTINCT row
FROM   (FROM bag1 INTERSECT ALL FROM bag2);



-- bag difference
FROM bag1 EXCEPT ALL FROM bag2;
FROM bag1 EXCEPT     FROM bag2;     -- discard duplicates

-- Simulate EXCEPT using EXCEPT ALL AND DISTINCT × 2(!):
SELECT DISTINCT row FROM bag1
  EXCEPT ALL
SELECT DISTINCT row FROM bag2;
