# SQL queries can be constructed dynamically, at program run time:
# embedded SQL queries are regular Python strings.
#
# 1. Interpolation:
#    Use query templates in which query parameters indicate where
#    Python values may replace SQL values (NOT: SQL names, SQL clauses)
#
# 2. Concatenation (⚠️ Risk of SQL injection—DO NOT USE)
#    Concatenating malicliously crafted strings to SQL query fragments
#    can subtantially alter the intended purpose of a query and may
#    be used to disclose database contents to attackers.

  # - Parameter $i (i >= 1) is replace by element i in parameter list.
  # - Alternatively, use named parameters (e.g., $prefix, $year) and
