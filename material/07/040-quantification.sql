-- SQL supports existential and universal quantification over

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Sample database:
-- Train services, stops, and stations in the Netherlands
-- (and neighbouring countries).  Derived from open data
-- provided by the Rijden de Treinen app (see the train archive on
-- https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data).

-- Database schema (three tables):
--
--   trains(ID, SERVICE, date, type, company,
--          completely_cancelled, partly_cancelled, max_delay)
--
--   stations(STATION, name)
--
--   stops((ID, SERVICE) -> trains, STATION -> stations,
--         arrival, arrival_delay, arrival_cancelled,
--         departure, departure_delay, departure_cancelled)
--
-- Notes:
-- - A train service is uniquely identified by key (id, service)
--   (services run repeatedly, trains may be split, ...)
-- - The *_delay columns (int) holds delays in minutes
