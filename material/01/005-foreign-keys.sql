-- QUIZ: Before we create table peeps below, define a (wide) table
--       vehicles_and_drivers which represents both vehicles and
--       their drivers.
--
--       When you insert rows into the instance of vehicles_and_drivers
--       what do you observe?


CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE peeps (
  pid    int PRIMARY KEY,        -- person (or peep) ID

-- SQL syntax:
--
-- Row order in a table is undefined.  For table output, can bring rows
-- into a defined order using SQL's ORDER BY clause.  The expressions
-- ‚Äπexpr‚ÇÅ‚Ä∫, ‚Äπexpr‚ÇÇ‚Ä∫, ... provide ordering criteria (primary first):
--
--  FROM ‚Äπt‚Ä∫
--  ORDER BY ‚Äπexpr‚ÇÅ‚Ä∫ [ASC|DESC], ‚Äπexpr‚ÇÇ‚Ä∫ [ASC|DESC]
--
-- - Ascending (modifier ASC) order is the default.
-- - NULLs are sorted last unless modifier NULLS FIRST is specified.

FROM peeps
ORDER BY born DESC;  -- youngest first

FROM peeps
ORDER BY born DESC NULLS FIRST;

FROM peeps

-- Foreign Keys

-- The current contents of column pid in table peeps (short: peeps(pid))
-- defines the currently valid peep IDs.  If we want to refer to peeps
-- as drivers, we may pick IDs ONLY from these contents.

-- SQL Syntax:
--
-- Constraint REFERENCES ‚Äπt‚Ä∫(‚Äπc‚Ä∫) restricts the values of its column
-- to be from the contents of column ‚Äπc‚Ä∫ in foreign table ‚Äπt‚Ä∫.  Since
-- we want  to uniquely identify drivers, ‚Äπc‚Ä∫ must be the PRIMARY KEY
-- or UNIQUE in foregin table ‚Äπt‚Ä∫.

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE vehicles (

                                       -- the primary key of table peeps

-- Foreign Keys vs Keys
--
-- In general, foreign keys are NOT keys in their own table.  See column
-- driver in table vehicles: carries NULL values and duplicates.
--
-- But: a foreign key CAN BE candidate for a key in its own table.
--
-- QUIZ: In the vehicles/peeps application, what are the consequences for
--       the domain if foreign key driver also is a key candidate?
